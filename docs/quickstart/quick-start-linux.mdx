You can run Redpanda directly on Linux. This 60-Second Guide helps you get started with Redpanda for development and testing.

For production or benchmarking, see [Deploying for Production](../../deployment/production-deployment).

## Install and run Redpanda

Installation requires just a few commands:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora/RedHat" default>


  ```bash
  ## Run the setup script to download and install the repo
  curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash && \
  ## Use yum to install redpanda
  sudo yum install redpanda -y && \
  ## Start redpanda as a service 
  sudo systemctl start redpanda
  ```


  </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian/Ubuntu" default>

```bash
## Run the setup script to download and install the repo
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash && \
## Use apt to install redpanda
sudo apt install redpanda -y && \
## Start redpanda as a service 
sudo systemctl start redpanda
```

  </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Verify that Redpanda is up and running: 

`sudo systemctl status redpanda`

The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
redpanda.service - Redpanda, the fastest queue in the West.
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/redpanda.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running)
```

You now have a single-node cluster running Redpanda.

## Start streaming

Use `rpk` to run commands. `rpk` is a CLI tool you can use to work with your Redpanda nodes. See [rpk Commands](../../reference/rpk/rpk-topic). Here are some sample commands to produce and consume streams:

Create a topic called `twitch_chat`:

```bash
rpk topic create twitch_chat
```

Produce messages to the topic:

```bash
rpk topic produce twitch_chat
```

Type text into the topic and click Ctrl + D to seperate between messages.

Click Ctrl + C to exit the produce command.

Consume (read) the messages in the topic:

```bash
rpk topic consume twitch_chat
```
    
Each message is shown with its metadata, like this:
    
```json
{
    "message": "How do you stream with Redpanda?\n",
    "partition": 0,
    "offset": 1,
    "timestamp": "2021-02-10T15:52:35.251+02:00"
}
```
